            <h2>Course Description</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Document Engineering</b> is an introduction to the creation of effective documents and documentation using industry-standard approaches to creating and treating <i>“documentation as code.”</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Participating in project-based and hands-on activities, students create purpose-driven digital writing with special attention to forms, formats, and conventions expected of contemporary technical communication.

                Students also gain experience with creating collaborative and ethically-consistent content while working in a team-based setting. During a weekly laboratory session, students employ contemporary software tools to complete technical documentation projects, reporting on their results through both written reflections and oral presentations.
