# Activity - HTML

## Objective
The purpose of this activity is to practice HTML skills by converting the content and format of a PDF file into an `index.html` file. You will recreate the provided `DocEngineer.pdf` file into an HTML document that reflects the same content and visual structure.

## Learning Outcomes
These assignment learning outcomes contribute to the following course learning outcomes described in the course syllabus:

1. Describe and explain processes such as software installation or design for a variety of technical and non-technical audiences ranging from inexperienced to expert.
2. Use professional-grade integrated development environments (IDEs), command-line tools, and version control systems to compose, edit, and deploy well-structured, web-ready documents and industry-standard documentation tools.
3. Identify and apply appropriate conventions of a variety of technical communities, tools, and computer languages to produce industry-consistent diagrams, summaries, and descriptions of technical topics or processes.

## Instructions

1. **Review the PDF File**:
   - Open the provided `DocEngineer.pdf` file.
   - Take note of its structure, formatting, and content.

2. **Create the HTML File**:
   - Create a new file named `index.html`.
   - Write HTML code to replicate the content and formatting of the PDF as closely as possible.

3. **Incorporate Required HTML Tags**:
   - Use appropriate HTML tags to structure the document, including:
     - **Header tags** (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.)
     - **Text formatting** (`<b>`, `<i>`, etc.)

     - **Links** (`<a href="">`)
     - **Images** (`<img>`)
     - **Tables** (`<table>`)
   - Maintain the visual hierarchy and formatting found in the PDF.

4. **Save and Test**:
   - Save your `index.html` file.
   - Open it in a web browser to ensure it matches the PDF in content and format.

5. **Submission**:
   - Submit your completed `index.html` file via the courseâ€™s submission platform.

## Example Layout
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Document Engineering</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Title from PDF</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>Subtitle</h2>
